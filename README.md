# Air Card
Air Card is a minimalist, material designed app to manage the "business cards" of people you interact with, without cluttering your phones' contacts list or needing to carry a bulky wallet full of paper cards. Simply enter in your name, snap a picture of the front and back of your business card, and your set to go to share your business card simply by tapping your NFC-enabled phone.
